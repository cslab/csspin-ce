.. FIXME: Nobody knows what this tool is and how to install it.

The ``csspin_ce.localization`` plugin provides a wrapper for the localization
(l10n) tool.

How to setup the ``csspin_ce.localization`` plugin?
###################################################

For using the ``csspin_ce.localization`` plugin, a project's ``spinfile.yaml`` must
at least contain the following configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Minimal configuration of ``spinfile.yaml`` for ``csspin_ce.localization``

    plugin_packages:
        - csspin_ce
    plugins:
        - csspin_ce.localization
    python:
        version: '3.11.9'
        index_url: <package server index url to retrieve CE wheels from>
    java:
        version: '17'
    node:
        version: '18.17.1'

The environment variable ``DEEPL_AUTH_KEY`` is required so that plugin can translate new
strings with `DeepL <https://developers.deepl.com/docs>`_.

Further configuration in ``spinfile.yaml`` is optional for this plugin.
In most cases you can rely on defaults. However, it's worth mentioning,
that you can configure the languages you want the component
to be localized into with ``target_languages`` parameter.

The provisioning of the required tools and the plugins dependencies can be done
via the well-known ``spin provision``-command.
